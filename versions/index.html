			<h1>Introducing Pinchzoom <b>Jan 23, 2011</b></h1>
			<p>It's been a while since my last post. Mostly due to the sorry internal state of this blog I have shut her down until I complete the Standardzilla redesign (which is coming along nicely). I have dozens of drafts sitting around, waiting to be released but I thought it better to wait.</p>

			<p>But, this I have to get out, redesign or not. Cheryl and I (of Molt:n Digital) are glad to be part of new agency pinch/zoom.</p>
		
			<p>This is pretty damn exciting for me. I have a lot of ideas about apps and mobile applications, but never a real excuse to work on many of them as day-to-day life and paid work can often get in the way of those things you want to do.</p>

			<p>The team at pinch/zoom are pretty amazing with tonnes of collective experience under their virtual belts. I have missed working in a team environment being a recent home office orphan so getting back into the team environment (virtual or not) should be awesome.</p>

			<p>Time to up my game, get some more damn blogs out (sorry Angus, more diary entries coming soon) and tie up these loose ends I have on my 'to-do' list. We have some apps to build.</p>
